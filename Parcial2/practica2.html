        <p>[Intro:] <br>
            Cause sometimes you just feel tired.<br>
            You feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up. <br>
            But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength <br>
            and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up <br>
            and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse. <br>
            <br>
            [B/W Intro:] <br>
            Go left, go left, go left right left <br>
            Go left, go left, go left right left <br>
            Go left, go left, go left right left <br>
            Go left, go left, go left right left <br>
            
            [Verse #1:] <br>
            Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel em <br>
            Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them <br>
            Cause when I am not then I am stop pinning them <br>
            And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem. <br>
            Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom <br>
            Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop. Amoxacilin is just not real <br>
            enough. <br>
            The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners. <br>
            Your coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god <br>
            lives in us. <br>
            You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up. <br>
            For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a <br>
            fuck. <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus - NateDogg] <br>
            Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out <br>
            Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. <br>
            Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out <br>
            I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. <br>
            Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out <br>
            Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. <br>
            Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out <br>
            I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse. <br>
            <br>
            [Verse #2:] <br>
            Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when your real <br>
            and you spit and people are feeling your shit. <br>
            This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it <br>
            cause you may never get it again. <br> 
            So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can <br>
            and when your run is over just admit when its at its end. <br>
            Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in. <br>
            I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in. <br>
            It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, <br>
            Nas and then me. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, <br>
            so when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me. <br>
            That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me. <br>
            Even though half you people got a fucken problem with me. <br>
            You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me <br>
            The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me. <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus - NateDogg] <br>
            <br>
            [Verse #3:] <br>
            Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC's heart <br>
            what is he thinking? I'ma not to go against me, smart. <br>
            And its absurd how people hang on every word. <br>
            I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve <br>
            But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved <br>
            If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first. <br>
            Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse. <br>
            That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse <br>
            My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict <br>
            I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers. <br>
            But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles <br>
            The fact is I would rather sit back and bump some rappers. <br>
            So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at them <br>
            The track is on some battling raps who want some static <br>
            Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters <br>
            A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest. <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus - NateDogg] <br>
            <br>
            [Outro:] <br>
            [Eminem & Natedogg Echo:] <br>
            Until the roof <br>
            The roof comes off <br>
            Until my legs <br>
            give out from underneath me <br>
            <br>
            [Eminem:] <br>
            I will not fall, <br>
            I will stand tall,<br>
            Feels like no one could beat me.</p>
